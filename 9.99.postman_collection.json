Once a session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for each session. If the `sessiontoken` parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is billed separately).\n\nWe recommend the following guidelines:\n\n- Use session tokens for all autocomplete sessions.\n- Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended.\n- Ensure that the API key(s) used for all Place Autocomplete and Place Details requests within a session belong to the same Cloud Console project.\n- Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session.

Waypoints alter a route by directing it through the specified location(s). The API supports waypoints for these travel modes: driving, walking and bicycling; not transit.   You can supply one or more locations separated by the pipe character (`|` or `%7C`), in the form of a place ID, an address, or latitude/longitude coordinates. By default, the Directions service calculates a route using the waypoints in the order they are given. The precedence for parsing the value of the waypoint is place ID, latitude/longitude coordinates, then address.\n* If you pass a place ID, you must prefix it with `place_id:`. You can retrieve place IDs from the Geocoding API and the Places API (including Place Autocomplete). For an example using place IDs from Place Autocomplete, see [Place Autocomplete and Directions](/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-directions). For more about place IDs, see the [Place ID overview](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id).\n  <div class=\"note\">For efficiency and accuracy, use place ID's when possible.

Unlike an address, ID's do not require the service to perform a search or an intermediate request for place details; therefore, performance is better.</div>\n* If you pass latitude/longitude coordinates, the values go directly to the front-end server to calculate directions without geocoding. The points are snapped to roads and might not provide the accuracy your app needs. Use coordinates when you are confident the values truly specify the points your app needs for routing without regard to possible access points or additional geocoding details. Ensure that a comma (`%2C`) and not a space (`%20`) separates the latitude and longitude values.\n* If you pass an address, the Directions service will geocode the string and convert it into latitude/longitude coordinates to calculate directions. If the address value is ambiguous, the value might evoke a search to disambiguate from similar addresses. For example, \"1st Street\" could be a complete value or a partial value for \"1st street NE\" or \"1st St SE\". This result may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API. You can avoid possible misinterpretations using place IDs.\n* Alternatively, you can supply an encoded set of points using the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm). You will find an encoded set is useful for a large number of waypoints, because the URL is significantly shorter. All web services have a URL limit of 8192 characters.\n  * Encoded polylines must be prefixed with `enc:` and followed by a colon (`:`). For example: `waypoints=enc:gfo}EtohhU:`.\n  * You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the pipe character (`|`). For example, `waypoints=via:enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:| via:enc:udymA{~bxM:`\n\n##### Influence routes with stopover and pass through points\n\nFor each waypoint in the request, the directions response appends an entry to the `legs` array to provide the details for stopovers on that leg of the journey.\n\nIf you'd like to influence the route using waypoints without adding a stopover, add the prefix `via:` to the waypoint. Waypoints prefixed with `via:` will not add an entry to the `legs` array, but will route the journey through the waypoint.\n\nThe following URL modifies the previous request such that the journey is routed through Lexington without stopping:\n\n```\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?\norigin=Boston,MA&destination=Concord,MA\n&waypoints=Charlestown,MA|via:Lexington,MA  \n```\n\nThe `via:` prefix is most effective when creating routes in response to the user dragging the waypoints on the map. Doing so allows the user to see how the final route may look in real-time and helps ensure that waypoints are placed in locations that are accessible to the Directions API.\n\n<div class=\"caution\">Caution: Using the `via:` prefix to avoid stopovers results in directions that are strict in their interpretation of the waypoint. This interpretation may result in severe detours on the route or `ZERO_RESULTS` in the response status code if the Directions API is unable to create directions through that point.</div>\n\n\n##### Optimize your waypoints\n\nBy default, the Directions service calculates a route through the provided waypoints in their given order. Optionally, you may pass `optimize:true` as the first argument within the waypoints parameter to allow the Directions service to optimize the provided route by rearranging the waypoints in a more efficient order. (This optimization is an application of the traveling salesperson problem.) Travel time is the primary factor which is optimized, but other factors such as distance, number of turns and many more may be taken into account when deciding which route is the most efficient. All waypoints must be stopovers for the Directions service to optimize their route.\n\nIf you instruct the Directions service to optimize the order of its waypoints, their order will be returned in the `waypoint_order` field within the routes object. The `waypoint_order` field returns values which are zero-based.\n\nThe following example calculates a road journey from Adelaide, South Australia to each of South Australia's main wine regions using route optimization.\n\n```\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?\norigin=Adelaide,SA&destination=Adelaide,SA\n&waypoints=optimize:true|Barossa+Valley,SA|Clare,SA|Connawarra,SA|McLaren+Vale,SA\n```\n\nInspection of the calculated route will indicate that calculation uses waypoints in the following waypoint order:\n\n```\n\"waypoint_order\": [ 3, 2, 0, 1 ]\n```\n\n<div class=\"caution\">Caution: Requests using waypoint optimization are billed at a higher rate. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/pricing#directions-advanced\">Learn more about how Google Maps Platform products are billed.</a></div>\n"

In those cases where Google does not possess exact elevation measurements at the precise location you request, the service interpolates and returns an averaged value using the four nearest locations. Elevation values are expressed relative to local mean sea level (LMSL).\n\nRequests to the Elevation API utilize different parameters based on whether the request is for discrete locations or for an ordered path.

Using coordinates will always result in the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates - which may not be an access point to the property, or even a road that will quickly or safely lead to the destination. Using the address will provide the distance to the center of the building, as opposed to an entrance to the building.</div>\n- **Coordinates**: If you pass latitude/longitude coordinates, they they will snap to the nearest road. Passing a place ID is preferred. If you do pass coordinates, ensure that no space exists between the latitude and longitude values.\n- **Plus codes** must be formatted as a global code or a compound code. Format plus codes as shown here (plus signs are url-escaped to %2B and spaces are url-escaped to %20):\n  - **global code** is a 4 character area code and 6 character or longer local code (`849VCWC8+R9` is encoded to `849VCWC8%2BR9`).\n  - **compound code** is a 6 character or longer local code with an explicit location (`CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA` is encoded to `CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA`).\n- **Encoded Polyline** Alternatively, you can supply an encoded set of coordinates using the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm). This is particularly useful if you have a large number of origin points, because the URL is significantly shorter when using an encoded polyline.\n  - Encoded polylines must be prefixed with `enc:` and followed by a colon `:`. For example: `origins=enc:gfo}EtohhU:`\n  - You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the pipe character `|`. For example: \n    ```\n    origins=enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:|enc:udymA{~bxM:\n    ```\n"

To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n* If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n* The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms for street in Hungarian."

If you set the mode to transit, you can optionally specify either a `departure_time` or an `arrival_time`.
